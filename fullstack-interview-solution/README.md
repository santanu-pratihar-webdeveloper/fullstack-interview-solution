# Full-Stack Interview Task â€” CodeIgniter 4 + React

This project was developed by **me** as part of the Full-Stack Developer Intern assignment.  
It demonstrates my ability to build a complete solution covering backend, frontend, database, and deployment.

---

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Backend:** CodeIgniter 4 with JWT authentication (register, login, protected APIs)  
- **Database:** MySQL by default, PostgreSQL optional  
- **Schema:** Two tables (`auth_user` â†” `teachers`) with a **1â€“1 relation**  
- **Special API:** Single POST endpoint that creates both a user and a teacher in one request  
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) app with login/registration and datatables for users & teachers  
- **DevOps:** Docker setup for quick startup (API + DB + Adminer UI)
